/// Settings › Harnesses: install a vendor CLI on a connected SSH host
/// (issue #89). The confirmation dialog shows the remote runtime's own
/// `harness install --dry-run --json` disclosure — exact command, install
/// destination, and selected version — and the installer itself runs in the
/// visible embedded terminal, where the user watches it like interactive
/// SSH auth. Codex resolves npm latest before confirmation, then installs that
/// exact approved version. The disclosure distinguishes release-verified
/// versions from deterministic targets without recorded verification fixtures;
/// the script vendors (Antigravity and Cursor) have their installer
/// downloaded in full and executed under the user's eyes because they
/// cannot be pinned. Every vendor NAME here comes from `HarnessFamily.label`
/// — never `id.capitalized`, which renders Antigravity as "Agy".
