/**
 * The terminal `resumable` block (INTERFACES §2): present on every terminal
 * whose WORK is unfinished and can be continued — non-success lifecycles and
 * `succeeded` runs whose work state is `needs_input`/`incomplete`. The attempt
 * loop decides it (`InRunContinuity.finish`); this owner materializes it as
 * `final/resumable.yaml` and the payload fragment every terminal event carries,
 * so no lane re-derives the block.
