/**
 * STRICT run-preflight model gate (INV-104): every route that resolved an
 * explicit model (per-run map or per-harness settings default) must pass its
 * harness's model truth source — the live `models()` inventory when the
 * adapter has one, else the manifest `known_models` list. A violation throws
 * a typed error BEFORE any vendor CLI spawns; the orchestrator surfaces it
 * through the routing-failure path, so failure.yaml names harness, model, and
 * truth source.
 *
 * Two rules keep the gate honest about WHICH account answered:
 * - The inventory is asked of the account the run will actually use. A
 *   profile-pinned route derives its auth route from that profile's credential
 *   kind, and the query carries the profile's own state HOME, so model truth
 *   can never come from the default credential store.
 * - Nothing about the spawned spec is rewritten to make the two agree. A
 *   profile-less `auto` run is enumerated with the same `auto` preference the
 *   adapter will resolve, so preflight and spawn share one resolution instead
 *   of the gate freezing a route the adapter would then be unable to disclose.
 *
 * A fallback model is checked by the authoritative per-spawn gate only after
 * its own quota/profile preflight; checking it against the primary profile
 * here would reject a valid cross-profile fallback.
 *
 * What a list may refuse with is the HARNESS's declaration: where the adapter
 * declared `model_inventory_absence: "advisory"`, its live inventory and its
 * manifest hints alike prove presence but not absence, so an unlisted explicit
 * model is forwarded to the vendor unchanged and disclosed once by the
 * per-spawn gate. An authoritative harness (the declaration a silent manifest
 * gets) refuses as before, and no gate ever swaps one list for another to
 * admit a model.
